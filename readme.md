# A "microscopic" examination of ActiveRecord scopes

This repo contains:

1. a `deck.rb` presentation, which will run in `marp`
2. supporting source code.
3. [2023-11-17] random other stuff which needs to go away.
4. Run the slides with `npx @marp-team/marp-cli@latest -s deck/`

## Microscope?

After some discussion when this was presented at
[East Bay
Rails](http://www.meetup.com/East-Bay-Rails/events/202907282/), the
audience decided that "microscope" would be a suitable term for what I
was calling a "driver" file, driver being too ambiguous. The microscope
(nee driver) file for the presentation is `src/arscope.rb`. It should
run by itself, or via `rspec arscope.rb`.

## License

Photos in the presentation are CC licensed, follow the photo credit
links for details.

Everything else is licensed "whatever." Do what you want. Make billions.

But do feel free to fork it or like it (or both), and if you would like
to present the deck elsewhere, it would be nice to throw me some credit
as an initial author, but I don't really care overmuch.
